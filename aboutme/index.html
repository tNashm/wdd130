  <h2>Tanner Meldrum</h2>
  <h2>Aka: Nash</h2>
  <p>My Name is Tanner Meldrum. I am currently an Automotive Technology Managment major, but I don't really like what I've been doing, so I'm starting to explore. I really like to play video games and generally making or taking things apart by hand. I have my own computer and have even disassembled and rebuilt a clock. I am recently married with no kids. For work, I am a sandblaster in St. Anthony. I love the assistance and help that is readily available here at BYU-I. I have been trying ot figure out what I want to persue, so the resources have been very helpful. I am a generally curious person, so the usefulness of web design is, at the moment, to satisfy that curiousity when it comes to how websites work. I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my entire life. I don't have any specific favorite quotes or scriptures, but I love to keep learning more about the Gospel. </p>
