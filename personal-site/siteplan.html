        Straightedge sand blasting and powder coating is a great option if you are looking for a cheaper, yet more durable option to standard paint on any metal projects you may be working on. Powder coat is a powdered resin-type material that is sprayed to evenly coat whatever has been prepped for the coating by etching the metal through sand blasting. This powder is cured in an oven to bind and solidify an even, durable coating that comes in just about every color you can imagine.</p>

        <p>There is also a plastic based coating commonly known as plascoat. Plascoat is typically more durable than the standard powder coat, but it is also more expensive. Given the durability, plascoat is a better option for any project that is going to experience more wear and tear, or exposure to the elements</p>

        <p>Whether or not you are going to be getting powder coat, and blasting is a fantastic way to clean rust or old paints off of metal, allowing you to have a better idea of what you may be working with when it comes to rusted or pitted metal.</p>
