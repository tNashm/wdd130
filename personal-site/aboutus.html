        <div class="panel">
            <p>Using high velocity air and sand, blasting can clear paint, rust and powdercoat off of just about any metal you bring in. We will blast anything from autobody to a hitching post. Depending on the project and the size of what we are blasting, we have two different blasters. The big blaster works best for large metal, auto paint or prior coating.
            The cabinet blaster works for smaller projects like bolts, smaller light fixtures.
            </p>
            <p class="rates">Our rates for blasting are: <br>Big Blaster: $130/hr <br>Cabinet Blaster: $65/hr</p>

Our powders come in a wide variety of colors and styles and if we don't have what you are looking for, we can order it <br>We also offer a plasticoat which is more durable than the standard powder coat, but would cost a bit more to use.</p>
