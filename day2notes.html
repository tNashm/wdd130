<p>Things within the head tag don't get shown anywhere other than the tab window. the body tag is shown on the page. The paragraph tag is just a P. Heading tags are h1-h6, valued in importance from 1-6. only use one h1 tag. Headings are paragraph headings. A header goes at the top of the the page or article and is tagged with header (typically an image or a navagation bar). A footer goes at the bottom of the page and is tagged with footer. An article is a body of text that makes sense on its own and is tagged with the word article. An image can be embedded in any tags that hold text. A div tag is just a generic tag, aka an unlabeled box. The aside tag is a non impotant bit of information that doesn't add anything to the page, like an ad. A non standard tag will be read as a div tag. A section tag will create a section and is written as section. The tag main, is information that is unique to each page. The ul tag is an unorganized list and is how to write bullets. To add multiple bullets, type li*X, specifying the number of bullets.
